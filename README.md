# CodeSync - Unity 
An IDE based Task Manager Extension

The Task Manager Extension is designed to facilitate seamless collaboration and task management within software development teams directly from your favoured IDE. It allows developers to create and manage nested lists of tasks, each with associated properties akin to JIRA tickets. Additionally, developers can attach code snippets, files, folders, and add comments to tasks, streamlining communication and task execution.

## Features

- **Task Creation and Management:** Create nested lists of tasks with customizable properties.
- **Properties and Details:** Assign properties to tasks such as title, description, assignee, status, priority, and more.
- **Attachment Support:** Attach code snippets, files, or entire folders to tasks for easy reference and execution.
